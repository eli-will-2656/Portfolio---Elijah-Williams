# MathHappens
Repo for CAD Designs! This the deliverables of a short and fun micro-internship at the MathHappens foundation. 
 - My project involved a laser cut puzzle inspired by the [mountain climber's problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_climbing_problem#:~:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20the%20mountain%20climbing,meet%20at%20the%20summit%2C%20) while in Graph theory!
- My favorite and most challenging part of the internship was learning how to use a laser cutter to create the mountain range.
- I am very thankfully to have participated in this [remote internship program](https://www.mathhappens.org/remote-intern-program-summer-2023/), and here are some of my final designs:
