There are two methods for locating foreign bodies in eyes.   
For method one, 
pull the eyelid away from the eyeball.  
Place a cotton swab 
along the back of the lid.   
Fold the patient's eyelid backward over the cotton swab.   
Look for any foreign bodies or damage to the eyeball.   
The second method for locating foreign bodies is as follows.   
Pull the lower lid down or the upper lid up.   
Have the patient look up, down, 
and to both sides.   
Check for objects in the eye as they look around.   
If nothing is found, 
bandage both eyes 
and seek help.   
The next step is to remove the foreign object.   
Hold the eye open 
or pull the eyelid away.   
For small foreign bodies, 
irrigate it out of the eye.   
Remove the body 
with a sterile cotton swab if stuck.   
If there is pain, 
bandage both eyes 
and seek aid.   
If the foreign body penetrates the eye, do the following.   
Apply dry sterile dressings to 
support the foreign body.   
Cover both the injured 
and uninjured eyes 
to minimize movement.   
Completing this step also prevents further contamination of the eye.   
Once these steps are complete, 
seek further medical aid immediately.
