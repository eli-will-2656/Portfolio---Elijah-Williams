Begin preparing for assessment and treatment of head wounds.   
Ensure you have necessary equipment, 
such as dressings and cravats. 
Secure a safe environment, 
clear of any close dangers.   
Prevent additional sicknesses 
by completing a patient care hand wash.   
Check the patient for signs and symptoms of head wounds.   
One type of head wound is a closed head injury.   
These are caused by a hard impact to the head.   
One symptom of this injury 
is deformity of the head.   
Symptoms of closed head injuries also include 
elevated body temperatures.  
Insufficient oxygen to the brain results in 
feelings of restlessness.   
The other type of wound is an open head injury.   
This includes penetrating entry wounds, 
with no exit wounds.   
Symptoms also involve 
paralysis to 
one side of the body.   
Open head injuries may also look like mangled scalp tissue.   
This kind of wound may result in extensive bleeding.   
Assess the patient's level of consciousness by the following assessments. 
The Glasgow Coma Scale looks at 
verbal 
and motor responses.   
It also checks if the patient's eyes are opening properly.   
For the AVPU scale, 
check if the patient is unresponsive.   
Ask the patient for 
the date, 
time, 
and their name.
