Begin by asking for the patient history and health record.   
There are two different types of soft tissue wound.   
Different complications may stem from each type of wound.   
For abrasions, 
amount of skin surface must be considered.   
This is because abrasions can lead to 
serious fluid loss.   
The second type of soft tissue injury 
is a contusion.   
One complication is 
underlying fracture 
by forceful impact of object.   
Another possibility is vascular involvement, 
or extensive blood in tissue.   
Measure and mark the outline of the contusion for record.   
Determine neurological involvement 
by testing sensation 
and movement of injured part. 
To initiate treatment for abrasions, follow the principles of management.   
These principles are: prevent infection, 
promote healing, 
and remove foreign objects. 
The abrasion should now be 
scrubbed gently with normal saline.   
Use a needle 
to remove matter that remains after scrubbing.   
Apply antibiotic ointment, 
informing patient to apply 
three times per day. 
Begin treatment for contusions by 
confirming the presence of any complications.   
Wrap injured area with roller bandage 
to compress the wound.   
Wrapping also serves the purpose of slowing bleeding into tissue.   
Refer any vascular or neurological injuries to a medical officer.   
Apply ice to area over wound 
and elevate casualty's wound.
