The goal here is to get a good measure of psychological properties of the words used to express ideas in a text, 
as they might influence how easy it is to "comprehend" the idea that a sentence is getting at.

These properties inlcude:
* Visualization -- Concreteness / Imageability
* Salience -- Arousal
* Exposure -- Word Frequency / Age of Acquisition / Grade Level

The measures of these properties come from online ratings provided by:
* Coh-metrix
* Word Pools

We want to make sure the information we are using to quantify text properties comes from a high-quality source, 
and covers the majority of words in each text.

Watch out for:
* Not being able to measure each word in a text
* Not accounting for multiple meanings a word can have
* Having measures not be readily interpretable
