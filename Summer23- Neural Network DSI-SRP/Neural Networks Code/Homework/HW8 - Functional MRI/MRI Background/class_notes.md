# Working with MRI data

## Part 1 - HaxBy data
* Permutation test - "gold standard", using distribution of data to determine the significance of result (e.g. 45% classification)

Null hypothesis: Brain region's activity is invariant to category being shown
* To demonstrate - permute all the test labels for each runs (no relationship between test label and fmri)
* Get accuracy of classifier for these permuted stest label

## Part 2

Representational Similarity / Disimilarity Matrx

How to calculate similarity between two vector?
* cosine similarity
* correlation matrix

Multidimensional Scaling
* projecting points in a high dimensional space to a sheet of paper
