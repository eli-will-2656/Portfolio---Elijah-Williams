# Vandy Projects!
- This repository contains code from several coding projects I have had the opportunity to participate in so far at Vanderbilt.
- Here some pictures reflective of the work I've completed so far!

# 2024
* This spring I participated in an Open Avenues internship creating a [PID controller](https://medium.com/@squonk-/understanding-pid-controllers-stable-flight-in-drones-and-beyond-861b1471c026) for a quadrotor. See it in action below!
* This summer I joined TAMU's math department to [model shock formations](https://people.tamu.edu/~maier/summerschool2024/)

# 2023
* This summer research project involved creating a two-layer neural network to model people's memory of reading. Here is my [project summary](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/datascience/2023/08/21/expanding-the-cmr-model-a-computational-investigation-of-reading-comprehension-dsi-srp/)!

# 2022
 * This Fall semester, I participated in a Codepath [Mobile-app](https://www.codepath.org/courses/intro-to-mobile-app-development) development program and a [Robotics](https://github.com/eli-will-2656/Vandy-Portfolio/tree/main/Fall22%20-%20PickleRobotCompany) micro-internship:

# 2021
* This year I worked on several individual SWE and CAD projects including designing a Q/A program using language models and a flashlight using Autodesk:
