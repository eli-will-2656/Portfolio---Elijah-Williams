# Vandy Projects!
- This repository contains code from several coding projects I have had the opportunity to participate in so far at Vanderbilt.

- The projects have ranged from creating mobile apps and games for fun, to optimizing robot trajectories and designing neural networks for research. 

- Here some pictures reflective of the work I've completed so far!
