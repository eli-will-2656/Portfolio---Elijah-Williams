# Vandy Projects!
- This repository contains code from several coding projects I have had the opportunity to participate in so far at Vanderbilt.

- The projects have ranged from creating mobile apps and games for fun, to optimizing robot trajectories and designing neural networks for research. 

- Here some pictures reflective of the work I've completed so far!

* This DSI-SRP project involved creating a two-layer neural network to model people's memory of reading. Here is my [project summary](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/datascience/2023/08/21/expanding-the-cmr-model-a-computational-investigation-of-reading-comprehension-dsi-srp/)!
