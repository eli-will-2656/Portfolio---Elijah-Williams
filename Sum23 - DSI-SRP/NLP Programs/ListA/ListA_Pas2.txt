To begin, determine cause and severity of casualty burns.   
Determine if they were exposed to 
smoke, steam, or combustion products.   
Possible causes include 
open flame, hot liquid, chemicals, or electricity.   
Explosions and lightning 
may cause burn and additional injury.   
These injuries may include 
internal injury, fracture, or spinal injury.   
Now you must prepare to stop the burn process.  
For thermal burns, 
the patient must stop, drop, and roll.   
If the cause is electrical, 
turn off the electrical current.   
Victims of lightning strikes 
may need prolonged respiratory support.  
For chemical burns, 
flush the area of contact with water immediately.   
Once the burn process is stopped, 
begin to treat the patient.   
Unblock the airway 
and check for signs of inhalation.   
Signs include 
singed eyebrows and eyelashes, hoarseness, and loud inhalation.   
Another sign is 
presence of carbon discoloration in the mouth.   
Oxygen must now be administered to patient 
at a high flow rate.   
Determine percentage of body surface area burnt 
and burn degree.   
The percentage
is calculated with the rule of nines.  
The head and neck
account for 9% of surface area.    
The upper limbs
host 18% of surface area  
(each 9%).  
The lower limbs   
carry 36% of surface area
(each 18%).
