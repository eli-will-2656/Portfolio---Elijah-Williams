Smaller and larger abscesses 
may require different methods for treatment. 
Smaller abscesses are 
typically less than five millimeters in diameter. 
Applying warm soaks can 
promote pus straining in smaller abscesses.   
Larger abscesses will 
require an incision 
to strain them.   
Signs of larger abscesses include
increased inflammation and pus collection. 
Ensure the appropriate precautions are met 
before treating the patient.   
Gather all necessary equipment required to care for the abscess.   
Position the patient so the abscess is easily accessible. 
Surround the abscess with cleaned drapes 
and cover adjacent areas.   
Lastly, apply anesthesia to the edge surrounding the abscess.   
Once required preparations are complete, 
perform the incision and strainage.   
Insert the syringe slightly under the skin 
to inject anesthetic.   
Next, cut open the abscess 
and strain out all pus.   
Apply gauze 
to soak up any excess pus or blood.   
Use caution, 
for abscesses could contain sharp or jagged objects.   
Record information about the abscess and procedure 
on SF 600.   
Describe details about 
the abscess prior to completing the procedure.   
Recount the procedure used, 
such as the quantity of anesthesia.   
Provide details on how the patient tolerated the procedure.   
Include any follow up care instructions given to the patient.
