Virtual environments is a folder with a python interpreter and downloaded packages for python code to run on.
It is used because sometimes you don't want code to run on global interpreter (which might have versions of packages/modules that aren't helpful)
(1) Create venv using command palette
(2) Activate venv using ps1 script in the folder.
