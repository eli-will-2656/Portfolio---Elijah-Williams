Inverse Kinematics
1. Create config_list = [] list of all possible configurations the robot could be in
	1.1. Can loop through each configuration and see if it is within bound
2. Compute whether the end effector is at a singularity (on the hollow ball), using Jacobian matrix

3. Solving 2R IK
	3.1:  Distance of gripper is invariant to q1 --> only varies with q2
		Solve for q2 (considering case when q1 = 0, and compare distances)

	3.2: q2 = fraction
		if   -1 < fraction < 1:
			q2 = [acos(fraction), -acos(fraction)]
		if fraction == 1 or fraction == -1:
			q2 = [acos(fraction)]
		else
			no solutions

	3.3: Return the elbow_up solution first (q2 > 0 )
