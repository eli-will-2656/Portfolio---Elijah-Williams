# 2R Optimization Project

- This micro-internship sponsored by [Open Avenues](https://www.openavenuesfoundation.org/)  involved using crocoddyl, an the open source optimal control library to solve a a 2-joint robotics optimization problem. In the project I collaborated with 2 other engineering students and Noe Fontana to make progress on this problem.

- PROJECT CHALLENGE: Increasing efficiency of robot movements is a constant battle that people in Mechatronics are fighting daily. In this project, you’ll wear the hat of Mechatronics Engineer and create an algorithm to optimize the trajectory of robotic arm used by our company. Under the supervision of an experienced Project Leader, you'll apply the industry's best practices in Mechatronics, Control, Optimization and Software Development to improve the trajectory followed by the robot. You'll select the 3 most promising algorithms, develop a motion planning and control system, and compare algorithm performance based on the provided set of criteria. 

 - PROJECT DELIVERABLES: At the last project session, you’ll present [your solution](https://github.com/eli-will-2656/Vandy-Portfolio/blob/main/Fall22%20-%20PickleRobotCompany/Final%20Implementation.ipynb) (Python implementation of the chosen algorithms) to the Project Leader in the form of a GitHub repository. You'll also prepare a [PDF report](https://github.com/eli-will-2656/Vandy-Portfolio/blob/main/Fall22%20-%20PickleRobotCompany/Final%20Paper.docx) with an analysis of the algorithms' performances and detailed descriptions of technical choices with their rationales. You will then discuss it in a format that mimics a job interview (so you are ready to talk about your work in real-life interviews).

- PROJECT TIMELINE: September 11, 2022 - November 1, 2022
